# Data Insight and Analysis Tool

## Project Description

This tool is designed to streamline data analysis and insights generation by integrating data from user-uploaded files (CSV, Excel) or Google Sheets with powerful web data retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using language models (LLMs). It allows users to dynamically retrieve information from the web, process this data with the Llama3 language model, and export structured insights. With features like error handling and custom prompts, this tool is ideal for use cases such as market research, customer analysis, human resources, and data enrichment.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushMayekar/Data_Insight_and_Analysis_Tool
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder and enter your API keys and required configurations:
```plaintext
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=path/to/your-google-service-account.json
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
```

- **GROQ_API_KEY**: API key for the Groq platform to use the Llama3 language model.
- **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE**: Path to the Google service account JSON file for accessing Google Sheets.
- **SERPAPI_KEY**: API key for SerpAPI, used for web scraping.

### 4. Run the Application

## Usage Guide

This tool provides an interactive interface for uploading or connecting data sources, selecting relevant data, running analysis, and exporting results.

### 1. Uploading Data

In the **Playground** section:
- **Choose a file** to upload (supported formats: CSV, Excel).
  - For Excel files, select the desired sheet from the dropdown.
- **Or connect to a Google Sheet**:
  - Enter the Google Sheet URL to import data directly from Google Sheets.
  - Ensure your Google account has permissions to access the sheet.

### 2. Selecting Columns for Analysis

After uploading data:
- Select specific columns for processing by using the **column selector**.
- This allows you to target specific data points for retrieval and analysis.

### 3. Entering a Custom Prompt

Once columns are selected:
- Enter a custom prompt in the provided text input box. Use placeholders like `{object}` to represent dynamic entities (e.g., company, website, or location).
- **Examples**:
  - "What is the headquarters location of {object}?"
  - "What continent does this {object} belong to?"

### 4. Processing and Reviewing Results

After defining your prompt:
- Click **Process Prompt** to retrieve and process data using:
  - **Web Retrieval**: Fetches real-time information from SerpAPI.
  - **RAG Integration**: Uses FAISS for vector search and Llama3 for generating insights.
- Review results in a structured table format.

### 5. Exporting Results

Use the **Download as CSV** button to save the generated results for further use.
