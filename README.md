# Data Insight and Analysis Tool

## Project Description

This tool is designed to streamline data analysis and insights generation by integrating data from user-uploaded files (CSV, Excel) or Google Sheets with powerful web data retrieval and language model (LLM) analysis capabilities. It enables users to retrieve relevant information from the web, process this data with the Llama3 language model, and export structured insights. This tool is particularly useful for market research, customer analysis, human resources, and data enrichment, allowing users to gain valuable insights with ease.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

For Python 3:

## Usage Guide

This tool provides an interactive interface that allows users to upload or connect data sources, select relevant data, run analysis, and export results.

### 1. Uploading Data

In the **Playground** section:
- **Choose a file** to upload (supported formats: CSV, Excel).
  - For Excel files, select the desired sheet from the dropdown.
- **Or connect to a Google Sheet**:
  - Enter the Google Sheet URL to import data directly from Google Sheets.
  - Ensure your Google account has permissions to access the sheet.

### 2. Selecting Columns for Analysis

After uploading data:
- Select specific columns for processing by using the **column selector**.
- This allows you to target specific data points for retrieval and analysis.

### 3. Entering a Prompt for Data Retrieval

Once columns are selected:
- Enter a prompt in the **text area** to specify the type of information you‚Äôre looking to retrieve.
  - Examples of prompts:
    - "Find the company headquarters location."
    - "Retrieve the company size for each listed company."
- Click **Process Prompt** to retrieve data from the web based on the prompt.

### 4. Reviewing Results and Exporting Data

After processing:
- The tool displays the gathered data and LLM-generated responses in a table format.
- Use the **Download as CSV** button to export the results for further analysis.

## API Keys and Environment Variables

To use this tool, you‚Äôll need API keys and other environment variables stored in a `.env` file:

- **GROQ_API_KEY**: Required for using the Llama3 language model on Groq [GROQ API KEY DOCUMENTATION](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE**: Path to the JSON file for your Google Service Account credentials to access Google Sheets [GOOGLE SHEETS GUIDE](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values).
- **SERPAPI_KEY**: Required for SerpAPI, enabling the tool to retrieve relevant web data based on user queries  [SerpAPI DOCUMENTATION](https://serpapi.com/).

### Example `.env` file
```plaintext
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=path/to/your-google-service-account.json
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
```

Ensure that each key is set up correctly and that your `.env` file is in the root directory of your project.
